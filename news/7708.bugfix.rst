When building PKG for ``onedir`` build, ensure that ``DATA`` entries
are put into dependencies list instead of including them in the PKG.
This complements existing behavior for ``BINARY`` and ``EXTENSION``
entries, and prevents a ``onedir`` build from becoming a broken
``onefile`` one if user accidentally passes binaries and data files
TOCs to ``EXE`` instead of `COLLECT` when manually editing the
spec file.
